# 1) Decision Tree
The Decisiontree.py file represents the usage of decision tree algorithm in machine learning. It is used to predict the 'saleprice' of a house, given some parameters. The data used is IOWA data from kaggle.
The most widely used terms and packages for machine learning in python are 
### sklearn(scikit library), pandas(library for data analysis), train data, test data, predictors, targets, model accuracy.
It is a good introductory algorithm which familiarizes the often used terms in machine learning in a practical way. There is chunk of description above the code which explains the terms in a way.
